# Aquarium Control

Automated lighting control and temperature monitoring software for an aquarium using a Raspberry Pi. Lighting can be run on a schedule, configurable by the user, that can change lights at a set time, or based on a solar event such as sunrise and sunset.

Note: figuring out how to connect the Pi to the lighting hardware is left as an exercise for the reader since there are so many different lighting systems out there.

Here's some photos of the system "in production" on my aquarium at home:
